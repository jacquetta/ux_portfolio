<body>
    <p>As a former Certified Medical Assistant, 
        my knowledge of how important it is to be detailed-oriented and empathetic helps me apply it towards my research as a UX designer and team-player.</p> 
       <p>In my spare time, I enjoy keeping up with my reading that can include any book from Dean Koontz to Don Norman, traveling and playing Nintendo with my son.</p></p>
